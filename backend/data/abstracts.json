      "text": "Drought stress induces abscisic acid (ABA) accumulation in guard cells, triggering stomatal closure through the activation of SLAC1 ion channels. Jasmonic acid (JA) enhances this response by upregulating MYC2 transcription factors. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediate signaling pathways, activating calcium channels.",
